# Features
- Operting with all IO bars
- Self builded core with ip
- MSI interrupt logic

# Notice
- This version have some sort of anti-paste to prevent it from selling by idiots like(Shalfey/Decoded)
- There's some bug with long boot (If you have a bsods on startup, disavle fastboot in bios) and that interrupts can't handle properly on win10 (If you dont know how to fix it, just use win11)
